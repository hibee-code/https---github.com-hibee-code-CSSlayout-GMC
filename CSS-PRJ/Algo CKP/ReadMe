Algorithm Checkpoint
At this checkpoint, you are asked to write an algorithm that read a sentence, which ends with a point, character by character, and to determine:

1. The length of the sentence (the number of characters).
2. The number of words in the sentence (assuming that the words are separated by a single space).
3. The number of vowels in the sentence.
